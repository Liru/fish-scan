A program that checks which words uniquely share letters with dictionary words

## Background
Someone said that "Ohio" is the only US state that doesn't share any letters with the word "mackerels". This program is an effort to check that, in a way; it will check if a word in a set is uniquely excluded by the letters in another word.
